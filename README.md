# `flock2`

`flock2` can fly a swarm of [DJI Tello](https://store.dji.com/product/tello) drones.
`flock2` is built on top of [ROS2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/),
 [fiducial_vlam](https://github.com/ptrmu/fiducial_vlam),
 and [tello_ros](https://github.com/clydemcqueen/tello_ros).

## Installation

### 1. Set up your Linux environment

Set up a Ubuntu 20.04 box or VM.

### 2. Set up your Python environment

Use your favorite Python package manager to set up Python 3.6+ and the following packages:

* numpy 1.15.2
* transformations 2018.9.5

### 3. Set up your ROS environment

[Install ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) with the `ros-foxy-desktop` option.

If you install binaries, be sure to also install the 
[development tools and ROS tools](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html)
from the source installation instructions.

Install these additional packages:
~~~
sudo apt install ros-foxy-cv-bridge ros-foxy-camera-calibration-parsers ros-foxy-gazebo-ros
~~~

### 4. Install dependencies

Download, compile and install the following packages:
~~~
mkdir -p ~/flock2_ws/src
cd ~/flock2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/clydemcqueen/flock2.git
git clone https://github.com/clydemcqueen/tello_ros.git
git clone https://github.com/ptrmu/fiducial_vlam.git
git clone https://github.com/ptrmu/ros2_shared.git
cd ..
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
# If you didn't install Gazebo, avoid building tello_gazebo:
colcon build --event-handlers console_direct+ --packages-skip tello_gazebo
~~~

## Running

### Flying a single drone

`launch_one.py` will allow you to fly a drone using a wired XBox One gamepad.

Turn on the drone, connect to `TELLO-XXXXX` via wifi, and launch ROS2:
~~~
cd ~/flock2_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch flock2 launch_one.py
~~~

Gamepad controls:
* menu button to take off
* view button to land
* B to start mission
* A to stop mission
 
### Flying multiple drones

`launch_two.py` provides an example for flying multiple drones.

Key elements of multi-drone missions:

* All drones must be networked together. One way to do this is to connect to each drone's wifi
using a Raspberry Pi 3 or similar device, and forward all UDP packets from the Pi to the host computer.
See [udp_forward](https://github.com/clydemcqueen/udp_forward) for an example using 2 Tello drones.
* Global nodes such as `flock_base` should have exactly 1 instance running.
Per-drone nodes such as `drone_base` should have 1 instance running per drone.
* Each drone has it's own ROS topic namespace. The default namespace for 1 drone is `solo`.
* Each drone must have it's own URDF file with the appropriate coordinate frames.
* The joystick controls one drone at a time. Hit the right bumper to select a different drone.
* All drones participate in the mission.

## Design

### Coordinate frames

[ROS world coordinate frames](http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html) are ENU (East, North, Up).

There are 3 significant coordinate frames in `flock2`:
* The world frame is `map`
* Each drone has a base coordinate frame. The default for 1 drone is `base_link`
* Each drone has a camera coordinate frame. The default for 1 drone is `camera_frame`

### The arena

An arena is a right rectangular prism defined by 2 points: (x1=0, y1=0, z1=0) and (x2, y2, z2).
z1 defines the ground, so z2 must be positive.
The ground must be flat.
Drones will never fly outside of the arena.

There must be at least one 6x6 ArUco marker, with id 1, associated with the arena.
Marker 1's pose is known in advance, the other ArUco marker poses are estimated during flight.
The drones will use ArUco marker poses to estimate their current pose.

### The mission (under development)

A mission is defined as autonomous flight by all drones.
A mission is initiated when the user hits the _start mission_ button on the gamepad.
A mission will end on it's own, or when the user hits the _stop mission_ button.

All drones must be able to localize on the ground to start a mission.
In practice this means that all drones must be able to see marker 1 while sitting on the ground,
or at least one drone has to be flown around manually to build a good map before the mission starts.

The overall mission dataflow looks like this:

1. `flock_base` publishes a message on the `/start_mission` topic
2. `planner_node` generates an overall pattern of flight for all drones, and publishes a 
sequence waypoints for each drone on `/[prefix]/plan`
3. `drone_base` subscribes to `~plan` and `~base_odom`, runs a PID controller,
and sends commands to `tello_ros`

If odometry stops arriving `drone_base` will execute a series of recovery tasks, which might include landing.

If flight indicates that a drone has a low battery `drone_base` will land the drone.

### Simulating 4 drones in Gazebo

[Install Gazebo 9 and build tello_gazebo](https://github.com/clydemcqueen/tello_ros/tree/master/tello_gazebo),
if you haven't already.

~~~
cd ~/flock2_ws
source install/setup.bash
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=${PWD}/install/tello_gazebo/share/tello_gazebo/models
source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
ros2 launch flock2 gazebo_launch.py
~~~

Hit the "B" button on the XBox controller to start the mission.
You should see 4 drones take off, rotate through 4 positions, then land.

## Versions and branches

`flock2` was developed along with several other projects while ROS2 was rapidly changing.
All of the related projects adopted similar conventions around branch names:
* the `master` branch works with the latest ROS2 release (Foxy as of this writing)
* there may be branches for older ROS2 versions, such as `crystal`, `dashing` or `eloquent`

The following projects and branches were tested together:

* ROS2 Foxy with fiducial_vlam:
  * git clone https://github.com/ptrmu/ros2_shared.git
  * git clone https://github.com/ptrmu/fiducial_vlam.git
  * git clone https://github.com/clydemcqueen/tello_ros.git
  * git clone https://github.com/clydemcqueen/flock2.git
